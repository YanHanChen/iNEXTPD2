Title: Interpolation and Extrapolation with Phylogenetic Diversity
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Anne Chao, Yan-Han Chen and Chun-Huo Chiu
Maintainer: Anne Chao <chao@stat.nthu.edu.tw>
Description: Provides functions for phylogenetic diversity analysis. (1) The iNEXT standardization for phylogenetic diversity: computes and plots rarefaction and extrapolation of phylogenetic diversity based on two types of standardization methods (sample size and sample coverage). (2) The phylogenetic diversity estimation: computes and plots asymptotic phylogenetic diversity profile as a function of diversity order (q-profile) or time (time-profile). The iNEXTPD2 package is an expanded and updated version of the old package iNextPD by adding more features. The iNextPD package has been removed from CRAN. Use iNEXTPD2 to replace iNextPD.
